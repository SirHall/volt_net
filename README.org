* VoltNet
  VoltNet is aimed at being a lightweight TCP networking library that thinly
  wraps around UNIX TCP sockets and should be both compatible with *NIX-based
  and Windows systems using Cygwin and MSYS2.

  This library is very early in development and therefore isn't industry
  ready.

  VoltNet provides a message-layer over the top of TCP's stream-based
  connections.

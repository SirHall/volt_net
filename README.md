# Volt Net

Volt net is a work in progress C++ library the goal of which is to unite multiple networking protocols under a single connection to allow for flexible communication between servers and clients.

This library's second goal is to remain minimal and not add too much baggage to your project.

# Why?

Not all communications needs to be through TCP. What if you want to send information using TCP, UDP, Unix Domain Sockets, SSH, 
Telnet but without the hassle of manually setting up each protocol per connection?

# Progress

Volt Net at the moment is very much in it's early stages and any contributions are welcome.
